\# Detection Philosophy



Core Principle: \*\*Not all Tor = Malicious, but all Tor = Worth Investigating\*\*



Tor can indicate:

\- Legitimate privacy needs (journalists, researchers)

\- Accidental connections

\- Data exfiltration

\- C2 communication

\- Ransomware callbacks

\- Insider threats

\- Hidden services / backdoors



We use layered context (direction, asset type, process, timing, volume, allowlists) to separate noise from real risk.
